		<p><b>New Delhi:</b> Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, whose chronic plain-speaking appears to have cost him his spot in the BJP's top decision-making body, has fired a new zinger. The government is "not taking decisions in time" and that's a problem, Mr Gadkari said at an event on Sunday.</p> 
		
		<p>&emsp; &ensp; &nbsp; "You can make miracles...and the potential is there...My suggestion is the future of Indian infrastructure is very bright. We need to accept good technology, good innovation, good research and successful practices in the world and in the country. We should have alternative materials by which we can reduce costs without compromising on the quality. And time is the most important thing in the construction. Time is the biggest capital. The biggest problem is the government is not taking decisions on time," said the Union Minister.</p>
